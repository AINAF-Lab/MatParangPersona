## 🎯 Executive Summary: Pedagogy Over Policy

**MPP validates functional AI teaching methodology through the L1-L5 persona approach.** Our strength lies in utilizing standardized, tiered models to provide students with **Intelligence Awareness**—a crucial prerequisite for responsible AI use that abstract ethical discussion cannot achieve.

The MPP methodology answers the student's fundamental question: *"How do I use AI tools safely and effectively?"* by defining three clear, functional tiers of AI capability.

### MPP Teaching Methodology Scorecard
| Teaching Component | Assessment | Pedagogical Value |
|-------------------|------------|-------------------|
| **AI Identity (L1-L4)** | Strong | Manages expectations by distinguishing current tools from hypothetical AGI |
| **AI Function (D/P/P Model)** | Superior | Teaches strategic prompt engineering for different task types |
| **AI Control (Autonomy L1-L5)** | Superior | Defines responsibility using the "Driver's Manual" approach |
| **Core Pedagogy** | Excellent | Low-friction focus accessible across all disciplines |

## 🏫 MPP's Strength: Functional Teaching with Standardized Tiers

MPP's core strength is adherence to universally accepted, non-technical classification scales that eliminate philosophical debates and focus on practical application.

### 1. AI Identity Model (The Four Stages)
MPP adopts the standard four-stage classification to teach AI capabilities:

| AI Type | Core Function | Student Takeaway |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| **Reactive Machines (L1)** | Acts on present input only | AI cannot learn or personalize over time |
| **Limited Memory AI (L2)** | Uses recent historical data | Calibrated trust - outputs must be verified |
| **Theory of Mind AI (L3)** | Hypothetical emotional capability | Prevents anthropomorphism |
| **Self-Aware AI (L4)** | Hypothetical consciousness | Understanding technology boundaries |

### 2. AI Functional Role Model (D/P/P Analytics)
Teaches strategic prompting by matching tasks to analytical output levels:

| Functional Role | Core Question | Appropriate Use |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Descriptive Analytics** | What happened? | Summarizing, categorization, outlines |
| **Predictive Analytics** | What might happen? | Forecasting trends, scenario generation |
| **Prescriptive Analytics** | What should be done? | Strategy proposals requiring human judgment |

### 3. Control Model (L1-L5 Autonomy Scale)
The most effective element - defines student responsibility clearly:

- **L1 (Operator)**: Direct human control (e.g., grammar check)
- **L3 (Semi-Autonomous)**: AI handles routine tasks, student as approver
- **L5 (Observer)**: Reserved for low-stakes simulation only

## 🎓 Why MPP's Functional Method Works

### Promotes Intelligence Awareness
MPP moves past technical confusion by defining AI's functional limits. The core lesson: AI systems have fundamentally different cognitive qualities than humans. Students learn to supplement human limitations rather than pursue unrealistic AI "partnerships."

### Supports Ethics Through Function
MPP recognizes that ethical use emerges from understanding function. By teaching the L1-L5 model, students internalize accountability: higher autonomy levels require greater responsibility for output accuracy and bias.

## 🗡️ The MPP Philosophy

**Like a master craftsman wielding a parang, MPP teaches students to skillfully wield AI tools through persona engineering.** We focus on practical mastery rather than theoretical compliance, enabling confident and effective AI collaboration.

### Core Principles
1. **Tool Mastery Over Tool Worship**: AI as practical instrument, not magical solution
2. **Persona Engineering as Core Skill**: Crafting effective AI collaboration roles
3. **Functional Understanding Before Ethics**: Skills enable responsible use
4. **Progressive Mastery**: L1-L5 pathway from basic to advanced collaboration
5. **Cultural Context Matters**: Malaysian approach for Malaysian education
